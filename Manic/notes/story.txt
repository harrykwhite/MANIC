Plot beats:
 * X goes on a hunting trip to gather food for his family. (opening tutourial segment / prologue)
 * After the trip, X returns to the house to find that it has been burnt down and his family killed.
 * In the remains of his burnt down house, he finds a remaining artifact that was left behind, detailing plans of destroying a "nearby town."
 
 * X finds and enters the "ravaged town" (level 1) to gather information about the killers. He finds that the town has already been destroyed and overrun.
 * X finds a surviving civilian of the town who is shell shocked and cannot speak.
 * X finds several items in the town that suggest towards what happened and who the killers are.
 
 * X leaves the area now with the understanding that his family was killed by a robot army. He heads towards the surrounding towns in search of help.
 * X finds a nearby farmland (level 2) that has not been overrun. X finds the owner of the farmland and warns him of impending danger. The farmer believes him, and joins X to help him stop the robot army.
 * Just as they are leaving, they encounter one of the heads of the group, "the scorched" (boss 1). X and the farmer fight "the scorched", who drops an upgrade that X picks up and equips. This
   begins the "abuse of power" arch in the story.
 * X and the farmer leave the farmland and explore an open environment. On the ground, the farmer finds a map of 3 bases of operation, being the underground bunker (level 3), the storage facility (level 4) and the prison (level 5).
 
 * X and the farmer journey through each of these three areas, collecting upgrades and clearing out robots from the area.
 
 * X and the farmer leave the prison and enter a snowy environment. Y is found waiting, X and Y talk and then fight each other.
 * X loses the fight, however Y does not kill him. Y tells him that they will meet at the city to fight again.
 * Before exiting, the farmer stops and decides that he no longer wants to help X for X is focused on killing and gaining power. Farmer senses that X is turning obsessive with violence.
 * X responds carelessly, and continues towards the nearest train station that he knows of so that he can travel to the city.
 
 * At the train station (level 6), X tries to overrun one of the enemy trains and kills the robot train driver and passengers.
 * X takes control of the train and travels towards a Cemetery (level 7) that is by the city.
 
 [Haven't decided what happens between level 7 and level 9]
 
 * X walks up to the dead body of Y, crouches down, and picks up his mask. He then observes it, puts it on, and walks off-screen.
 * "MANIC" logo appears and credits play.
