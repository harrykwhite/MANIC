note_text = "- November 28th 1948 -\n\nAn ordinary day for the most part. Went up to the front of the bunker up north to help pave some snow away. Heard numerous shouting noises coming from inside. Normally the bunker is quite empty, so it came as quite a surprise to me. Hopefully everything's all right in there.";
