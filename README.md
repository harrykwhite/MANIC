*MANIC* is a 2D action-adventure game released under the name of Geta Games Team, an online game development team I ran in my free time between 2015 and 2021. The game entered development at the end of 2017 (when I was 14) and was first released on December 3rd 2019. Although the game was released under the name of the team, almost all of the game was done by me, as at the time I was clueless about how to properly delegate tasks and inspire other people to contribute to a project. The music and some sound effects were done by a very talented musician named Frank Albrecht, in which I truly think his music is the best aspect of the game by far.
